These guidelines are experimental and only meant for select creators. We do not recommend following these guidelines for all experiences.
</Alert>

This document outlines guidelines for creating and managing Roblox experience descriptions. The primary goal is to improve SEO for better discovery through external search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo.

## Context

Top games have millions of impressions in any given month on Google alone. Depending on the search query, however, copycat games, wikis, videos, and game publications might rank above the official link to your game. There is a large opportunity to translate more of this external search traffic into direct visits to your games' official details pages.

### Key objectives

- Enhanced User Clarity: Provide prospective players with a more clear and comprehensive understanding of what the game is, how it is played, and why they should play it before they click to join.
- Improved Search Engine Performance: By including more descriptive text and relevant keywords, the external search engine crawlers will be able to more accurately index and categorize the game. This will lead to better visibility in search results and targeted recommendations.

## Content recommendations

Your description should contain the following:

- **[Hook]** A very short description up to 160 characters of the game with core keywords
- **[Recent Updates (Optional)]** A blurb of your game's recent or upcoming updates
- **[Main Content]** An expansion of this description focused on the game mechanics
- **[Additional Information]** Device support, codes, and FAQ

Feel free to use emojis as desired for extra flair.

### The hook

The first ~160 characters of your description is the most critical section as it will be the content that will likely populate search snippets and what new users first see.

_(Google bolds the keywords that they think are relevant to the query)_

- Use your title, core genre, and the most unique feature.
- Include primary search terms/keywords.
- Immediately communicate the main objective.
- Example:
  - Less optimized: X is a fun, action-packed time with friends to work together to defeat enemies.
  - Better:
    - X is a fast-paced tower defense game to build up your fortress and fend off hordes of enemies. Can you build the ultimate base and survive all 500 levels?
    - Welcome to X, the #1 tower defense game on Roblox. Build up your defenses to face off against hordes of enemies. Will you have what it takes to endure all 500 levels?

This hook will also be what will show on the mobile app until the user expands the description content, so it's very important to make this engaging.

### (Optional) Recent updates

Give a brief blurb about any recent updates your game may have had. While good for your returning users, keep in mind that the more content you have in this section, the further this pushes down the main content of your description that will be more useful to new users.

Aim to keep this short, only highlighting the main attractions of your updates.

#### Examples

🏴‍☠️ [NEW] Quest Expansion!  
Explore new islands and complete exciting quests

🚨 SEASON 9 is here! Featuring the new DANGER cosmetic set and updated player stats!

### Main content

Detail your game's core gameplay and key features in an easily digestible format. Feel free to use bullet points, or write full sentences in paragraph format.

- Describe the main gameplay loop
- Give the reader a glimpse into what it is they'll be doing in your game
- Be sure to outline your game's key selling points that differentiate it from others

#### Examples

🦈 500+ different fish to catch  
🎣 Licensed fishing gear brands like X, Y, Z and more!  
🐡 Explore unlimited customization options  
🏅 Compete with your friends on the leaderboards

### Additional information

- **Device availability:** Mention platform support (e.g. Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet) if applicable.
- **(Optional) Redeem codes:** any you'd like to showcase if applicable
- **(Optional) Premium benefits:** if your game has it, you can show it off here. If character count becomes a problem, consider this as one of the first things to cut.
- **(Optional) Small FAQ section** below the rest of the description content.
  - Focus on basic questions here, like "How do I X?" or "What is X?".
  - **⚠️ Warning:** FAQs can take up a lot of your 1000 character count, so be concise and deliberate with your wording. Avoid too many questions, or just answer commonly asked questions in your description text.
- **(Optional) Changelog / Credits:** This should be a link to devforum for your changelog / credits.

### Additional notes

- Tags and hashtags are explicitly not recommended. They are unused in our ranking algorithms and serve only to eat up your character count limit.
- Please do not enumerate your game's controls in the description. New players should learn the controls through a clear tutorial, and it can eat into the character limit a lot, depending on control complexity. We would instead ask you to clearly outline them in your game itself.
- Keep the entire description appropriate for all ages.
