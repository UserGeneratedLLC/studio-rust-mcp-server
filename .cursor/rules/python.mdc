# Python Code Style

## Formatting
- 2-space indentation
- Double quotes for strings
- f-strings for formatting
- Max line width ~100 chars
- Break long function declarations/calls across multiple lines

## Types
- Type declarations on function parameters and return types only
- Don't add types where inference is obvious (constants, assignments)

## Code Organization
- Use `pathlib` for file paths
- Prefer built-in Python libraries when suitable
- Blank lines between functions; condensed within functions
- Use blank lines meaningfully to separate logical sections

## Comments & Debugging
- Minimal comments - let types and names speak
- No docstring comments for parameters/return values
- No scattered print statements for debugging

## Dependencies
- Modern, maintained packages only
- Up-to-date practices

## User-Facing Messages
- Descriptive error messages for input/output issues
- Keep internal error strings minimal

## UI/Styling
- Dark mode preferred
- Modern, clean UI/text

## Restrictions (unless specifically asked)
- Never create python tools or test scripts
- Don't modify JSON configs
- Don't run test commands
- Don't generate READMEs
