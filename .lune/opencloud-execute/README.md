# Open Cloud Luau Execution for Lune

A basic wrapper for Roblox's Open Cloud Luau execution APIs. An API key must be provided via an environment variable called `RBX_API_KEY` or the `set_api_key` function.

This module is very barebones, and assumes a basic understanding of OpenCloud endpoints. It is designed to abstract the need to write your own wrapper, not abstract away your understanding of what's happening.
