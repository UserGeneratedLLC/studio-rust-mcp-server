[Comms]
We probably need to upgrade to msgpack so we can support nulls/infs

[OpenCloud APIs MCP]
Use env to get API KEY
Start hooking up all known open cloud APIs
Endpoints:
* upload_asset

[Reference Paths]
During a session we can utilize an auxilary instance ref uuid via GetUniqueId(0)
This string can accompany paths with a format like (its not always a number tmk):
ReplicatedStorage/SomeInstance~1523
These are only stable per studio session, so they should be included in metadata responses about instances
This is helpful for editing instance trees with duplicated children/ambiguous paths

[Instance codec]
Need to develop codec for transmitting instances
Use msgpack for transmission
Duplicate paths handled by naming `{inst.Name}~{inst.GetUniqueId(0)}`
Grab MaximumADHD's reflection json via github. use in Rust+Plugin. create luau/rust types for it.
{
  "Name": "InstanceName",
  "ClassName": "Part",
  "UniqueId": "GetUniqueId(0) output, e.g. 1234af",
  "Properties": {
    "Text": "Hello",
    "Shape": {"Enum.PartType": "Block"},
    "Anchored": true,
    "Size": {"Vector3": [4, 1, 2]},
    "Color": {"Color3": [0.5, 0.7, 0.0]},
    "CFrame": {"CFrame": [[0,5,0], [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]]},
    "Material": {"Enum.Material": "SmoothPlastic"},
    "Attachment0": {"Reference": "Some/Path[~123]"},
    "Attachment1": null,
    "Health": 37,
    "ViewDistance": {"number": "inf"}
  },
  "Attributes": {
    // Same semantics as Properties with what Attributes actually support
  },
  "Tags": [ "Tag" ],
  "Children": {
    // If any children share a name, ALL of that name get ~ suffix
    "Handle~a1b2": {
      // ...
    },
    "Handle~f31a": {
      // ...
    }
  }
}

[Studio Plugin MCP]
* Any instance which is determined to have an ambiguous path (duplicate parent naming/children naming) is suffixed automatically:
 - During a session we can utilize an auxilary instance ref uuid via GetUniqueId(0)
 - This string can accompany paths with a format like (its not always a number tmk):
 - ReplicatedStorage/SomeInstance~1523
 - These are only stable per studio session, so they should be included in metadata responses about instances
 - This is helpful for editing instance trees with duplicated children/ambiguous paths
* Should utilize msgpack for encoding scheme
Endpoints:
* run_code command [DONE]
 - Runs arbitrary Luau in Studio edit mode, returns print output
* get_console_output [DONE]
 - Returns Studio output window contents
* get_studio_mode [DONE]
 - Returns one of: start_play, run_server, stop
* start_stop_play mode [DONE]
 - mode: start_play | run_server | stop
* run_script_in_play_mode code [mode] [timeout] [DONE]
 - Runs in play/server mode, auto-stops, returns structured result
 - Result: { success, value, error, logs, errors, duration, isTimeout }
* insert_model query [DONE]
 - Searches marketplace, inserts into workspace, returns model name
* get_instance_tree path [depth]
 - outputs our instance codec scheme noted above
* set_properties path data
 - msgpack data so it supports nulls/infs, leaves unreferenced values
 - supports refs
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* get_properties path
 - msgpack data so it supports nulls/infs, leaves unreferenced values
* add_tags path tags
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* remove_tags path tags
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* get_tags path
* get_attributes path
* set_attributes path data
 - msgpack data so it supports nulls/infs, leaves unreferenced values
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* delete_instances paths
* set_parent path parentPath
 - returns path
* create_instance path classname
 - could include optional properties, tags, and attributes
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* take_screenshot [path]
 - Path could be a ScreenGui, a Part, Model - anything. Will intelligently crop.
 - Encode as PNG over wire
 - Output to agent as base64
* clone_instance path targetParent
 - should send back the resulting path
* get_selections
* set_selections paths
* get_place_info
 - UniverseID, PlaceId, PlaceName, etc
* undo [times]
* redo [times]
* rename_instance path newName
 - returns path
* get_script_source path
* set_script_source path source
* search_instances [name] [tag] [classname]
 - needs more thought, this can be a goldmine of an endpoint of setup right.
 - inspiration should be grep
* publish_place [target placeid, defaults to our placeid]

[Cookie APIs MCP]
Use that one library to automatically fetch the roblox studio cookie
use that for any other endpoints which opencloud doesnt currently support
Endpoints:

[Luau Code Execution]
We can use OpenCloud to perform remote luau code execution
This can be helpful for uploading assets which OpenCloud doesnt support directly
or even running code in roblox games in a headless mode.

[CI]
Setup automated testing of rust code
Setup automatic building of the plugin
