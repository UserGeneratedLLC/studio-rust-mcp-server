[Studio Plugin MCP]
* rename tools to match the rust side exactly, e.g. "InsertModel.luau" should be "insert_model.luau" for simplicity and reduced constants.
* For "set_studio(studio_id=X)", can we just make it "set_studio(id=X)" for simplicity? or even just "set_studio(x)" if prudent.
* Handle inf/nan values somehow

[Merging]
we need to do a cursor style code merging/accept UI in roblox studio when we do this
this would eliminate needing cursor at all, and you would just be using Claude desktop app + roblox studio.

[Footnotes: Existing Roblox Studio MCP Projects]
As of Feb 2026, nobody has built the full vision above. Here's what exists:

1. boshyxd/robloxstudio-mcp (TypeScript, 223 stars, 39 tools)
   https://github.com/boshyxd/robloxstudio-mcp
   Monorepo: packages/core (shared tools), packages/robloxstudio-mcp (full), packages/robloxstudio-mcp-inspector (read-only 21 tools).
   Studio plugin built with roblox-ts, distributed as .rbxmx.
   Tool categories (from definitions.ts, 1347 lines):
   - Instance browsing: get_file_tree, search_files (by name/type/content), get_services,
     search_objects (by name/class/property), get_instance_properties, get_instance_children,
     search_by_property, get_class_info, get_project_structure (with maxDepth + scriptsOnly)
   - Properties: set_property, mass_set_property, mass_get_property
   - Creation: create_object (with optional properties), mass_create_objects, delete_object
   - Duplication: smart_duplicate (naming patterns {n}, cumulative position/rotation/scale
     offsets per copy, property variations, different parents per copy), mass_duplicate
   - Calculated properties: set_calculated_property (formula expressions like "index * 50"),
     set_relative_property (add/subtract/multiply/divide/power with Vector3/UDim2 components)
   - Script editing: get_script_source (with startLine/endLine for large scripts),
     set_script_source, edit_script_lines, insert_script_lines, delete_script_lines
   - Attributes: get_attribute, set_attribute (with valueType hint), get_attributes, delete_attribute
   - Tags: get_tags, add_tag, remove_tag, get_tagged (reverse lookup by tag)
   - Selection: get_selection
   - Execution: execute_luau (plugin context, captures return value)
   - Script search: grep_scripts (ripgrep-inspired: case sensitivity, Lua patterns, context lines,
     maxResults, maxResultsPerScript, filesOnly mode, path scoping, classFilter)
   - Playtest: start_playtest (play/run), stop_playtest, get_playtest_output (polling)
   - Undo/Redo: undo, redo (via ChangeHistoryService)
   - Build Library: export_build (serialize to compact JSON with palette + normalized positions),
     create_build (from compact part arrays), generate_build (procedural JS code with primitives:
     room, roof, stairs, column, arch, fence, wall, floor, fill, beam, row, grid — max 10000 parts),
     import_build, import_scene (full scene layout with model refs + positioning),
     list_library, get_build, search_materials (MaterialVariant lookup in MaterialService)
   - Assets: search_assets (Creator Store by type: Audio/Model/Decal/Plugin/MeshPart/Video/
     FontFamily, with sort/filter), get_asset_details (creator, votes, pricing),
     get_asset_thumbnail (base64 PNG for vision LLMs), insert_asset (by ID with position),
     preview_asset (load, inspect hierarchy tree, destroy — peek without committing)
   What they have that we don't: smart_duplicate, set_calculated_property, Build Library system,
   preview_asset. Everything else is in our TODO or covered by our broader tools.

2. CoderDayton/roblox-bridge-mcp (TypeScript/Bun, 2 stars, 99 operations)
   https://github.com/CoderDayton/roblox-bridge-mcp
   Architecture: FastMCP + Bun runtime. Single unified `roblox` tool with method dispatch
   (roblox-tools.ts, 212 lines). All 99 ops go through one tool with {method, params}.
   Bridge: HTTP long-polling + WebSocket. Auto port discovery (tries 8081-8090).
   Plugin: Lua with auto-discovery, bearer token auth, exponential backoff reconnect.
   Operations by category (from source):
   - Instance: CreateInstance, DeleteInstance, CloneInstance, RenameInstance
   - Discovery: GetFullName, GetParent, IsA, GetClassName, WaitForChild
   - Properties: SetProperty, GetProperty
   - Hierarchy: GetChildren, GetDescendants, FindFirstChild, GetService
   - Transforms: MoveTo, SetPosition, GetPosition, SetRotation, GetRotation,
     SetSize, GetSize, PivotTo, GetPivot
   - Appearance: SetColor, SetTransparency, SetMaterial
   - Physics: SetAnchored, SetCanCollide, CreateConstraint, SetPhysicalProperties, GetMass
   - Scripting: CreateScript, GetScriptSource, SetScriptSource, AppendToScript,
     ReplaceScriptLines, InsertScriptLines, RunConsoleCommand
   - Selection: GetSelection, SetSelection, ClearSelection, AddToSelection,
     GroupSelection, UngroupModel
   - Lighting: SetTimeOfDay, SetBrightness, SetAtmosphereDensity, CreateLight
   - Attributes/Tags: SetAttribute, GetAttribute, GetAttributes, AddTag, RemoveTag,
     GetTags, HasTag
   - Players: GetPlayers, GetPlayerPosition, TeleportPlayer, KickPlayer
   - Place: SavePlace, GetPlaceInfo
   - Audio: PlaySound, StopSound
   - Terrain: FillTerrain, ClearTerrain
   - Camera: SetCameraPosition, SetCameraFocus, GetCameraPosition
   - Utilities: GetDistance, HighlightObject, Chat
   - History: Undo, Redo
   What they have that we don't: GroupSelection/UngroupModel, lighting suite, player interaction
   (teleport/kick), audio (PlaySound/StopSound), camera control, HighlightObject, GetDistance,
   Chat, SavePlace. Their terrain is basic (fill/clear only). No Open Cloud, no asset search,
   no line-level script editing, no build library, no CSG, no clipboard.

3. Roblox/studio-rust-mcp-server (Rust, 365 stars, 6 tools)
   https://github.com/Roblox/studio-rust-mcp-server
   Our fork base. Rust + axum web server + rmcp stdio transport. Plugin long-polls.
   Only 6 tools: run_code, insert_model, get_console_output, start_stop_play,
   run_script_in_play_mode, get_studio_mode. Clean architecture, auto-setup for
   Claude Desktop and Cursor. Plugin is plain Lua (not roblox-ts).

4. notpoiu/roblox-executor-mcp (TypeScript, 4 stars)
   https://github.com/notpoiu/roblox-executor-mcp
   Game CLIENT bridge (not Studio). index.ts is 3025 lines — everything in one file.
   Requires a Roblox executor with loadstring + request + WebSocket support.
   Tools (from source):
   - Execution: execute (run Lua), execute-file (run local .luau), get-data-by-code (run + return)
   - Scripts: get-script-content (decompile), search-scripts-sources
   - Introspection: list-clients, get-console-output, search-instances (CSS-like selectors
     via QueryDescendants), get-descendants-tree, get-game-info
   - Remote Spy: ensure-remote-spy (loads Cobalt), get-remote-spy-logs, clear-remote-spy-logs,
     block-remote, ignore-remote — intercept/log/block RemoteEvent/RemoteFunction traffic
   - Screenshot: list-roblox-windows, screenshot-window (by PID, Windows only)
   - GUI: click-button (simulate TextButton/ImageButton click), type-text-box
   - Multi-client: connect multiple Roblox clients simultaneously, target by clientId.
     Primary/secondary mode with auto-promotion. Cross-machine via --baseurl.
   What's interesting for us: remote spy concept for debugging during playtesting,
   GUI interaction (click_button, type_text) for automated testing, multi-client architecture,
   cross-machine support. Most exploiter-specific features (decompile, executor requirement)
   are not relevant.

5. christopher-buss/roblox-docs-mcp (TypeScript)
   https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@christopher-buss/roblox-docs-mcp
   Roblox documentation semantic search. ChromaDB + OpenAI text-embedding-3-large.
   Auto-pulls from Roblox/creator-docs via git. Redis caching. Configurable chunk size
   (default 1000 chars) with 200 char overlap.
   Tools: searchRobloxDocs, getRobloxApiReference, findRobloxTutorials, getRobloxGuides.
   Not a Studio interaction tool — purely for giving AI agents Roblox knowledge.
   We accomplish this via .cursor/rules/roblox/ docs instead.

6. quanticsoul4772/mcp-roblox (Rust, 1 star, claims 47 tools)
   https://github.com/quanticsoul4772/mcp-roblox
   Rust MCP with bearer token auth. Claims 920+ unit tests.
   Categories: Filesystem (8), Studio (14), Open Cloud (11), Toolchain (9), AI (4), Monitoring (1).
   Open Cloud tools: publish_place, upload_asset, datastore get/set, ordered_datastore CRUD,
   get_universe, restart_servers, messaging_publish.
   Toolchain: StyLua, Selene, Rojo build/sourcemap, Wally, Moonwave, Lune, luau-lsp.
   AI: Voyage AI embeddings + Neo4j knowledge graph for semantic code search.
   Reads heavily AI-generated (Claude/ChatGPT style). CLAUDE.md + knowledge.md + multiple
   guide markdown files committed to repo. No community adoption. Could be useful as
   reference for Open Cloud API integration patterns.

7. dmae97/roblex-studio-mcp-server (TypeScript, 6 stars)
   https://github.com/dmae97/roblex-studio-mcp-server
   Mostly scaffolding. npx install, Open Cloud API key wiring, Claude Desktop integration docs.
   Has node_modules committed to git. Not much real functionality.

8. Bbasche/roblox-ai (Python, 2 stars)
   https://github.com/Bbasche/roblox-ai
   Python MCP + FastAPI bridge on port 8765. Claude Code with --dangerously-skip-permissions.
   Simple architecture: MCP server exposes tools -> bridge queues commands -> plugin polls.
   Includes load_reference_image for vision-based building. Marketed toward non-coders.

9. Alexpoopy1/roblox-studio-mcp-server-V1 (TypeScript, 2 stars)
   https://github.com/Alexpoopy1/roblox-studio-mcp-server-V1
   Bare-bones. Node on port 8081 + Lua plugin in ServerScriptService.
   Requires play mode (F5) to function. Plugin polls server.

10. Rxuser2/Roblox-MCP-Unified (JavaScript/Node, 0 stars)
    https://github.com/Rxuser2/Roblox-MCP-Unified
    8 tools for Lua/Luau script CRUD with SQLite storage. Express 4.x + Helmet.js.
    Web dashboard with dark/light theme, charts, responsive design.
    Docker + Railway deployment ready. HMAC auth + rate limiting.
    Does NOT connect to Studio — manages script files on disk only.
    Written in Indonesian/English mix. AI-generated.

11. majidmanzarpour/vibe-blocks-mcp (Python/FastAPI, 66 stars per Glama)
    https://github.com/majidmanzarpour/vibe-blocks-mcp
    Was listed on Glama/playbooks with Open Cloud DataStore, asset upload, place publish.
    Repo returns 404 as of Feb 2026. May be deleted or private.

Deleted/404 repos also found: Sxf0z/RoMCP, 0xXrer/mcp.
Also found on Glama: code-and-relax (enhanced boshyxd fork, 37+ tools, long polling).

[Footnotes: Features Others Ship That We Don't Plan To Add]
- Build Library system (boshyxd) — export_build, create_build, generate_build (procedural JS
  code with room/roof/stairs/column/arch/fence primitives), import_build, import_scene,
  list_library, get_build, search_materials. Full local build asset pipeline.
- smart_duplicate (boshyxd) — duplicate with naming patterns ({n}), cumulative position/rotation/
  scale offsets per copy, property variations per copy, different target parents per copy.
  Also mass_duplicate for batching.
- set_calculated_property (boshyxd) — set properties via formula expressions ("index * 50")
  with custom variables. Different from our set_relative_property which is just += style ops.
- Lighting suite (CoderDayton) — SetTimeOfDay, SetBrightness, SetAtmosphereDensity, CreateLight
- Camera control (CoderDayton) — SetCameraPosition, SetCameraFocus, GetCameraPosition
- Audio (CoderDayton) — PlaySound, StopSound
- Player interaction (CoderDayton) — GetPlayers, GetPlayerPosition, TeleportPlayer, KickPlayer
- GroupSelection / UngroupModel (CoderDayton)
- SavePlace (CoderDayton)
- HighlightObject (CoderDayton) — visual highlight with color and duration
- GetDistance (CoderDayton) — distance between two objects
- Chat (CoderDayton) — send system message to TextChatService
- Remote spy (notpoiu) — intercept/log/block RemoteEvent/RemoteFunction traffic via Cobalt.
  Exploiter-specific but debugging concept is interesting.
- Docs semantic search (christopher-buss) — ChromaDB + OpenAI embeddings over Roblox creator-docs.
  We handle this via .cursor/rules/roblox/ instead.
