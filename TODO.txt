[App]
* Rename the project to something better
* Cleanup latent project files from the original github
* Update README.md
* Auto install as a service
* Auto-install to the mcp.json with the http mode
* Auto-install the plugin automatically
* Auto-update
* Add proper rust logging lib like we had on Atlas D:\UserGenerated\rojo
 - replace all eprint's and print's with this logging.
 - ensure correct log levels for everything
 - make sure console colors work as expected
* Update and improve the ServerInfo data
 - We should probably move this to a file instead? See what other big MCPs do. An icon would be nice, too.

[OpenCloud APIs MCP]
Use env to get API KEY
Start hooking up all known open cloud APIs
Endpoints:
* upload_asset file [name] [assetid for replacing]
* search_asset
 - Searches the group for a given asset
* "place configurations"
* "experience configurations"
* "luau code execution"

[Studio Plugin MCP]
* rename tools to match the rust side exactly, e.g. "InsertModel.luau" should be "insert_model.luau" for simplicity and reduced constants.
* For "set_studio(studio_id=X)", can we just make it "set_studio(id=X)" for simplicity? or even just "set_studio(x)" if prudent.
* Handle inf/nan values somehow
Endpoints:
* run_code command [DONE]
 - Runs arbitrary Luau in Studio edit mode, returns print output
* get_console_output [DONE]
 - Returns Studio output window contents
* get_studio_mode [DONE]
 - Returns one of: start_play, run_server, stop
* start_stop_play mode [DONE]
 - mode: start_play | run_server | stop
* run_script_in_play_mode code [mode] [timeout] [DONE]
 - Runs in play/server mode, auto-stops, returns structured result
 - Result: { success, value, error, logs, errors, duration, isTimeout }
* insert_model query [DONE]
 - Searches marketplace, inserts into workspace, returns model name
* get_instance_tree paths [depth]
 - outputs our instance codec scheme noted above
* set_properties paths data
 - msgpack data so it supports nulls/infs, leaves unreferenced values
 - supports refs
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* get_properties paths
 - msgpack data so it supports nulls/infs, leaves unreferenced values
* add_tags paths tags
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* remove_tags paths tags
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* get_tags paths
* get_attributes paths
* set_attributes paths data
 - msgpack data so it supports nulls/infs, leaves unreferenced values
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* delete_instances paths
* set_parent paths parentPath
 - returns paths
* create_instance paths classname
 - could include optional properties, tags, and attributes
 - probably respond with current instance state?
* take_screenshot [paths]
 - Path could be a ScreenGui, a Part, Model - anything. Will intelligently crop.
 - Encode as PNG over wire
 - Output to agent as base64
* get_selections
* set_selections paths
* get_place_info
 - UniverseID, PlaceId, PlaceName, time info, StudioService, etc...
* undo [times]
* redo [times]
* rename_instance paths newName
 - returns paths
* get_script_source paths
* set_script_source paths source
* search_script_source filter [includes] [excludes]
 - model after grep
* query query [parents]
 - SEE: https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance#QueryDescendants
* publish_place <target placeid, defaults to our placeid>
* docs ClassNames
 - returns roblox docs given a classname https://github.com/Roblox/creator-docs/tree/main/content/en-us/reference/engine/classes
 - we could probably just include this as a Skill on how to browse the roblox docs git
* schema ClassNames
 - includes property info with inheritence info, defaults, enum options, hierarchy
* clone Paths Parent
 - should send back the resulting path
* transform_parts paths cframe [pivot] [shallow]
 - applies both rotation/translation in one
* translate_parts paths vector3 [shallow]
* rotate_parts paths angle-vector3 [pivot] [shallow]
* scale_parts paths vector3 [pivot] [shallow]
* translate_frame paths udim2
* scale_frame paths vector2
* rotate_frame paths degree
* get_clipboard
* set_clipboard
* ability to copy/paste from other studio instances
 - we could accomplish this with SerializationService .rbxm's
 - i'm not sure this would retain references to things like SoundGroup, etc.
* enabling/disabling physics model view
 - in general we should expose a ton of those studio settings
* statistics
 - instance count, performance, etc
* access to profiler?
* undo via ChangeHistoryService
* redo via ChangeHistoryService
* history via ChangeHistoryService
* get_script_history
* open_place placeid
* TODO: csg building
* TODO: get_linter_errors / get_script_analysis

[Cookie APIs MCP]
Use that one library to automatically fetch the roblox studio cookie
use that for any other endpoints which opencloud doesnt currently support
Endpoints:
* placeid <-> gameid
* place information
* game information
* searching for games
* list games in group
* group information
* user information
* search catalog
* search users
* search toolbox
* toolbox assets

[Other]
Endpoints:
* trim_transparency file
* resize_image file out-file [mode]

[Merging]
we need to do a cursor style code merging/accept UI in roblox studio when we do this
this would eliminate needing cursor at all, and you would just be using Claude desktop app + roblox studio.
